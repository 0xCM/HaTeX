# HaTeX README

`HaTeX` is the LaTeX syntax implementation done in Haskell.

## TODO list

* Add more examples.
* More testing on the parser.
* Add more documentation.
* A more complete `AMSMath` module.

## Installation notes

* To install `HaTeX`, use the typical `cabal install`.
* Eventually you may require to install `mtl` first (there is a problem with the `transformers` dependency).

## HaTeX User's Guide

* The HaTeX User's Guide lives [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Diaz/HaTeX-Guide).
