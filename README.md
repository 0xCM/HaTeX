# `HaTeX` README

`HaTeX` is the LaTeX syntax implementation done in Haskell.

## TODO list

* Add more examples.
* More testing on the parser.
* Add more documentation.
* A more complete `AMSMath` module.

## Instalation notes

* To install `HaTeX`, use the typical `cabal install`.
* Eventually you may require to install `parsec` or `mtl` first (there is a problem with the `transformers` dependency).
